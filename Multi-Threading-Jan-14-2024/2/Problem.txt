Problem 2: Producer-Consumer Problem
Description:
Implement a simple producer-consumer problem with a buffer. Create two threads, a producer, and a consumer. 
The producer should produce items and add them to the buffer, while the consumer should consume items 
from the buffer. Ensure that the producer and consumer do not interfere with each other.
