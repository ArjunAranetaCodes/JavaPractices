public class UserServiceTest {

    @Test
    public void testNoInteractionsWithDependency() {
        // Create mock objects
        UserRepository userRepository = mock(UserRepository.class);
        EmailService emailService = mock(EmailService.class);

        // Create the service under test
        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository, emailService);

        // Perform some operation that shouldn't interact with emailService
        userService.getUserById(1L);

        // Verify that no interactions occurred with emailService
        verifyZeroInteractions(emailService);
    }
}

// Classes used in the test
class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;
    private final EmailService emailService;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository, EmailService emailService) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
        this.emailService = emailService;
    }

    public User getUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }
}

interface UserRepository {
    User findById(Long id);
}

interface EmailService {
    void sendEmail(String to, String subject, String body);
}

class User {
    // User properties and methods
}
```

In this example:

1. We create mock objects for `UserRepository` and `EmailService` using Mockito's `mock()` method.

2. We instantiate the `UserService` class with these mock objects.

3. We call the `getUserById()` method on `userService`, which should only interact with `userRepository` and not with `emailService`.

4. Finally, we use `verifyZeroInteractions(emailService)` to ensure that no methods were called on the `emailService` mock during the test.

This test will pass if `emailService` is not used during the `getUserById()` operation. If any method on `emailService` is called, the test will fail.

Note: As of Mockito 3.0.0, `verifyZeroInteractions()` has been deprecated in favor of `verifyNoInteractions()`. If you're using a recent version of Mockito, you should use `verifyNoInteractions(emailService)` instead.
