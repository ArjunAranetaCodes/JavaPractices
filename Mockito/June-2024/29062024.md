Certainly! I'll create a Mockito script that demonstrates the use of `verifyNoMoreInteractions()`. This method is useful for ensuring that no unexpected interactions occurred on a mock object after verifying all expected interactions.

Here's a sample Mockito script using `verifyNoMoreInteractions()`:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

public class UserServiceTest {

    @Test
    public void testUserServiceInteractions() {
        // Create a mock object
        UserRepository userRepository = mock(UserRepository.class);
        
        // Create the service using the mock repository
        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository);

        // Define the behavior of the mock
        when(userRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(new User(1L, "John Doe"));

        // Call the method we want to test
        User user = userService.getUserById(1L);

        // Verify the expected interactions
        verify(userRepository).findById(1L);

        // Ensure no more interactions occurred on the mock
        verifyNoMoreInteractions(userRepository);
    }
}

// Classes used in the test (these would typically be in separate files)
class UserService {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User getUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }
}

class UserRepository {
    public User findById(Long id) {
        // This would typically interact with a database
        return null;
    }
}

class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    public User(Long id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}
```

In this script:

1. We create a mock `UserRepository` using `mock()`.
2. We create a `UserService` instance using the mock repository.
3. We define the behavior of the mock using `when()`.
4. We call the method we want to test (`getUserById()`).
5. We verify the expected interaction using `verify()`.
6. Finally, we use `verifyNoMoreInteractions(userRepository)` to ensure that no other methods were called on the mock repository.

The `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` method is particularly useful in catching unexpected calls to the mock object. If any other method on the `userRepository` mock was called during the test, `verifyNoMoreInteractions()` would cause the test to fail.

This approach helps in writing more robust tests by ensuring that your code is interacting with dependencies exactly as expected, no more and no less.
