Certainly! I'll create a Mockito script that demonstrates the usage of `verifyNoMoreInteractions`. This method is used to verify that no other interactions occurred on a mock object beyond what has been explicitly verified.

Here's a sample Mockito script that uses `verifyNoMoreInteractions`:

```java
import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;
import org.junit.Test;

public class UserServiceTest {

    @Test
    public void testUserServiceInteractions() {
        // Create a mock object
        UserRepository userRepository = mock(UserRepository.class);
        
        // Create the service and inject the mock
        UserService userService = new UserService(userRepository);

        // Define the behavior of the mock
        when(userRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(new User(1L, "John Doe"));

        // Call the method we want to test
        User user = userService.getUserById(1L);

        // Verify the expected interactions
        verify(userRepository).findById(1L);

        // Verify that no more interactions occurred on the mock
        verifyNoMoreInteractions(userRepository);
    }
}

// Simplified User class
class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    public User(Long id, String name) {
        this.id = id;
        this.name = name;
    }

    // Getters and setters omitted for brevity
}

// UserRepository interface
interface UserRepository {
    User findById(Long id);
}

// UserService class
class UserService {
    private UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserService(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    public User getUserById(Long id) {
        return userRepository.findById(id);
    }
}
```

In this script:

1. We create a mock `UserRepository` using `mock(UserRepository.class)`.
2. We inject this mock into a `UserService` instance.
3. We define the behavior of the mock using `when(...).thenReturn(...)`.
4. We call the method we want to test: `userService.getUserById(1L)`.
5. We verify that the expected interaction (`findById(1L)`) occurred using `verify(userRepository).findById(1L)`.
6. Finally, we use `verifyNoMoreInteractions(userRepository)` to ensure that no other interactions occurred on the `userRepository` mock.

The `verifyNoMoreInteractions(userRepository)` call will pass if there were no other interactions with the `userRepository` mock beyond the `findById(1L)` call that we explicitly verified. If any other methods were called on the mock, this verification would fail, indicating unexpected interactions.

This approach is useful for ensuring that your code is not making any unexpected calls to dependencies, which can help catch bugs and maintain clean, well-defined interfaces between components.
