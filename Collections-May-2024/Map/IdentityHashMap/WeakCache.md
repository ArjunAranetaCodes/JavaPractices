## Problem: 
Implementing a Weak Cache

## Description: 
Create a program that demonstrates the use of IdentityHashMap to implement a weak cache, which allows entries to be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced elsewhere.

## Input:

Cache entries: {"Key1", "Value1"}, {"Key2", "Value2"}, {"Key3", "Value3"}

## Output:

Cache entries:

Key1 = Value1

Key2 = Value2

Key3 = Value3

After garbage collection:

Key1 = null

Key2 = null

Key3 = null

## Code Answer:
```Java
import java.lang.ref.WeakReference;
import java.util.IdentityHashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class WeakCache {
    private IdentityHashMap<WeakReference<Object>, Object> cache;

    public WeakCache() {
        cache = new IdentityHashMap<>();
    }

    public void put(Object key, Object value) {
        cache.put(new WeakReference<>(key), value);
    }

    public Object get(Object key) {
        return cache.get(new WeakReference<>(key));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WeakCache cache = new WeakCache();

        Object key1 = new Object();
        Object key2 = new Object();
        Object key3 = new Object();

        cache.put(key1, "Value1");
        cache.put(key2, "Value2");
        cache.put(key3, "Value3");

        System.out.println("Cache entries:");
        for (Map.Entry<WeakReference<Object>, Object> entry : cache.cache.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey().get() + " = " + entry.getValue());
        }

        // Allow key1 and key2 to be garbage collected
        key1 = null;
        key2 = null;

        System.gc();

        System.out.println("After garbage collection:");
        for (Map.Entry<WeakReference<Object>, Object> entry : cache.cache.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry.getKey().get() + " = " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }
}
```

This program demonstrates the use of IdentityHashMap to implement a weak cache, which allows entries to be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced elsewhere. The WeakCache class uses an IdentityHashMap with weak references as keys to store cache entries, and provides methods for adding and retrieving values. The main() method tests the cache by adding entries, allowing some keys to be garbage collected, and retrieving values.

Note: IdentityHashMap is used with weak references as keys to allow entries to be garbage collected if they are no longer referenced elsewhere. This is useful for creating caches, dictionaries, and other similar data structures that need to be accessed by reference, but also need to allow entries to be garbage collected if they are no longer needed.
