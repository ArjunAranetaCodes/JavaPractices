# Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm Tutorial

## Overview

Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores all vertices at the current depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It's like exploring a maze by checking all rooms on the current floor before going to the next floor.

## Key Concepts

### 1. How BFS Works
- **Level-by-Level Traversal**: BFS visits all vertices at distance 1, then all at distance 2, and so on
- **Queue Data Structure**: Uses a queue to maintain the order of vertices to visit
- **Visited Tracking**: Keeps track of visited vertices to avoid cycles

### 2. Algorithm Steps
1. Start with a source vertex
2. Add it to a queue and mark as visited
3. While queue is not empty:
   - Remove a vertex from queue
   - Process the vertex (print, analyze, etc.)
   - Add all unvisited neighbors to queue
   - Mark neighbors as visited

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures Used
- **Adjacency List**: `LinkedList<Integer>[]` for graph representation
- **Queue**: `LinkedList<Integer>` for BFS traversal
- **Boolean Array**: `boolean[]` for tracking visited vertices
- **Parent Array**: `int[]` for path reconstruction

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the queue and visited array

## Key Methods

### 1. Basic BFS Traversal
```java
public void bfs(int startVertex)
```
- Performs standard BFS traversal
- Prints vertices in BFS order

### 2. BFS with Level Tracking
```java
public Map<Integer, Integer> bfsWithLevels(int startVertex)
```
- Returns the level (distance) of each vertex from start
- Useful for understanding graph structure

### 3. Shortest Path Finding
```java
public List<Integer> findShortestPath(int startVertex, int targetVertex)
```
- Finds shortest path in unweighted graphs
- Returns path as list of vertices

### 4. Bipartite Graph Detection
```java
public boolean isBipartite()
```
- Checks if graph can be colored with 2 colors
- Uses BFS with alternating colors

## Applications

### 1. Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs
- GPS navigation systems
- Social network connections
- Web crawling

### 2. Level-Order Traversal
- Tree traversal
- Hierarchical data processing

### 3. Graph Analysis
- Connected components
- Bipartite graph detection
- Cycle detection

### 4. Real-World Examples
- **Social Networks**: Finding connections between people
- **Web Crawling**: Discovering web pages
- **GPS Navigation**: Finding shortest route
- **Game AI**: Pathfinding in games

## Example Usage

```java
// Create graph with 6 vertices
BreadthFirstSearch graph = new BreadthFirstSearch(6);

// Add edges
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(1, 4);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 5);
graph.addEdge(4, 5);

// Perform BFS
graph.bfs(0);

// Find shortest path
List<Integer> path = graph.findShortestPath(0, 5);
```

## Sample Output

```
Graph Representation (Adjacency List):
Vertex 0 -> 1 2 
Vertex 1 -> 3 4 
Vertex 2 -> 4 
Vertex 3 -> 5 
Vertex 4 -> 5 
Vertex 5 -> 

BFS Traversal starting from vertex 0:
0 1 2 3 4 5 

BFS with Levels starting from vertex 0:
Vertex 0 at level 0
Vertex 1 at level 1
Vertex 2 at level 1
Vertex 3 at level 2
Vertex 4 at level 2
Vertex 5 at level 3

Shortest path from 0 to 5: [0, 1, 3, 5]
Path length: 3

Is the graph bipartite? true
```

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- ✅ Guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs
- ✅ Simple to implement and understand
- ✅ Works well for level-based problems
- ✅ Memory efficient for shallow graphs

### Disadvantages
- ❌ May use more memory for deep graphs
- ❌ Not optimal for weighted graphs
- ❌ Can be slower than DFS for deep searches

## Practice Problems

1. **Level Order Traversal**: Print tree nodes level by level
2. **Word Ladder**: Transform one word to another
3. **Number of Islands**: Count connected components
4. **Perfect Squares**: Find minimum squares to sum to n
5. **Open the Lock**: Find minimum moves to unlock

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Queue Management**: Always check if neighbor is visited before adding to queue
2. **Path Reconstruction**: Use parent array to backtrack from target to source
3. **Level Tracking**: Use separate queue or track level with each vertex
4. **Multiple Sources**: Initialize queue with multiple start vertices for multi-source BFS
