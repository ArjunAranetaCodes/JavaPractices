# Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm Tutorial

## Overview

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a fundamental graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It's like exploring a maze by going as deep as possible down one path before trying another.

## Key Concepts

### 1. How DFS Works
- **Deep Exploration**: DFS explores one path completely before backtracking
- **Stack/Recursion**: Uses stack (recursion) to maintain the path being explored
- **Backtracking**: Returns to previous vertices when reaching dead ends

### 2. Algorithm Steps
1. Start with a source vertex
2. Mark it as visited and process it
3. For each unvisited neighbor:
   - Recursively apply DFS
4. Backtrack when no more unvisited neighbors

## Implementation Details

### Data Structures Used
- **Adjacency List**: `LinkedList<Integer>[]` for graph representation
- **Stack**: For iterative implementation or recursion stack
- **Boolean Array**: `boolean[]` for tracking visited vertices
- **Recursion Stack**: For recursive implementation

### Time and Space Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E) where V = vertices, E = edges
- **Space Complexity**: O(V) for the recursion stack/visited array

## Key Methods

### 1. Recursive DFS
```java
public void dfsRecursive(int startVertex)
```
- Uses recursion for natural backtracking
- Simple and elegant implementation
- May cause stack overflow for very deep graphs

### 2. Iterative DFS
```java
public void dfsIterative(int startVertex)
```
- Uses explicit stack to avoid recursion
- Better for very deep graphs
- More control over the traversal

### 3. Connected Components
```java
public List<List<Integer>> findConnectedComponents()
```
- Finds all connected components in the graph
- Handles disconnected graphs
- Returns list of component vertices

### 4. Cycle Detection
```java
public boolean hasCycle()
```
- Detects cycles in directed graphs
- Uses recursion stack tracking
- Essential for topological sorting

### 5. Topological Sort
```java
public List<Integer> topologicalSort()
```
- Orders vertices in dependency order
- Only works for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)
- Uses DFS with post-order processing

### 6. Path Finding
```java
public List<Integer> findPath(int source, int destination)
```
- Finds any path between two vertices
- Uses backtracking when path doesn't lead to target
- Returns empty list if no path exists

### 7. Path Counting
```java
public int countPaths(int source, int destination)
```
- Counts all possible paths between vertices
- Uses backtracking to explore all paths
- Useful for path analysis

## Applications

### 1. Graph Traversal
- **Maze Solving**: Finding path through maze
- **Game Tree Exploration**: Chess, tic-tac-toe AI
- **Web Crawling**: Discovering web pages

### 2. Graph Analysis
- **Connected Components**: Finding isolated subgraphs
- **Cycle Detection**: Identifying circular dependencies
- **Topological Sorting**: Task scheduling, build systems

### 3. Path Problems
- **Path Finding**: Finding routes between points
- **Path Counting**: Analyzing connectivity
- **Backtracking**: Solving puzzles, constraint satisfaction

### 4. Real-World Examples
- **Build Systems**: Dependency resolution
- **Task Scheduling**: Project management
- **Circuit Design**: Logic gate dependencies
- **Social Networks**: Friend recommendations

## Example Usage

```java
// Create graph with 6 vertices
DepthFirstSearch graph = new DepthFirstSearch(6);

// Add edges
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(1, 4);
graph.addEdge(2, 4);
graph.addEdge(3, 5);
graph.addEdge(4, 5);

// Recursive DFS
graph.dfsRecursive(0);

// Find connected components
List<List<Integer>> components = graph.findConnectedComponents();

// Check for cycles
boolean hasCycle = graph.hasCycle();

// Find path
List<Integer> path = graph.findPath(0, 5);
```

## Sample Output

```

```

## Recursive vs Iterative DFS

### Recursive DFS
**Advantages:**
- ✅ Simple and elegant code
- ✅ Natural backtracking
- ✅ Easy to understand

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ Stack overflow for deep graphs
- ❌ Less control over traversal
- ❌ Harder to modify for specific needs

### Iterative DFS
**Advantages:**
- ✅ No stack overflow issues
- ✅ More control over traversal
- ✅ Easier to modify and extend

**Disadvantages:**
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Manual stack management
- ❌ Slightly more memory usage

## When to Use DFS vs BFS

### Use DFS when:
- **Deep Exploration**: Need to explore deep paths
- **Backtracking**: Need to try different paths
- **Topological Sort**: Working with DAGs
- **Cycle Detection**: Finding cycles in graphs
- **Connected Components**: Finding isolated subgraphs

### Use BFS when:
- **Shortest Path**: Need shortest path in unweighted graphs
- **Level Order**: Need level-by-level processing
- **Shallow Graphs**: Graph is wide rather than deep
- **Memory Efficiency**: Need to minimize memory usage

## Practice Problems

1. **Number of Islands**: Count connected land masses
2. **Word Search**: Find words in 2D grid
3. **Course Schedule**: Check if courses can be completed
4. **All Paths**: Find all paths in binary tree
5. **Sudoku Solver**: Solve Sudoku puzzle using backtracking

## Tips and Tricks

1. **Visited Tracking**: Always mark vertices as visited to avoid cycles
2. **Backtracking**: Use recursion or explicit stack for natural backtracking
3. **Path Reconstruction**: Store parent pointers for path finding
4. **Multiple Sources**: Start DFS from multiple vertices for disconnected graphs
5. **Post-order Processing**: Use for topological sort and dependency resolution

## Common Mistakes

1. **Forgetting Visited Array**: Can cause infinite loops
2. **Wrong Recursion Base Case**: Can cause stack overflow
3. **Not Handling Disconnected Graphs**: May miss some vertices
4. **Incorrect Backtracking**: May not explore all paths
5. **Memory Issues**: Deep recursion can cause stack overflow
