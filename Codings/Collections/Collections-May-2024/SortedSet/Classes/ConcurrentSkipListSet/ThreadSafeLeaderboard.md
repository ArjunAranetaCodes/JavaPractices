## Problem: 
Implementing a Thread-Safe Leaderboard

## Description: 
Create a program that demonstrates the use of ConcurrentSkipListSet to implement a thread-safe leaderboard.

## Input:

Players and scores: [{"Player1", 100}, {"Player2", 50}, {"Player3", 150}, {"Player4", 75}]

## Output:

Leaderboard:

Player3 (150)

Player1 (100)

Player4 (75)

Player2 (50)

## Code Answer:
```Java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentSkipListSet;

public class ThreadSafeLeaderboard {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConcurrentSkipListSet<Player> leaderboard = new ConcurrentSkipListSet<>();

        // Multiple threads adding players and scores concurrently
        Thread t1 = new Thread(() -> {
            leaderboard.add(new Player("Player1", 100));
            leaderboard.add(new Player("Player2", 50));
        });
        Thread t2 = new Thread(() -> {
            leaderboard.add(new Player("Player3", 150));
            leaderboard.add(new Player("Player4", 75));
        });

        t1.start();
        t2.start();

        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Leaderboard:");
        for (Player player : leaderboard) {
            System.out.println(player);
        }
    }
}

class Player implements Comparable<Player> {
    String name;
    int score;

    public Player(String name, int score) {
        this.name = name;
        this.score = score;
    }

    @Override
    public int compareTo(Player other) {
        return Integer.compare(other.score, this.score);
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return name + " (" + score + ")";
    }
}
```

This program demonstrates the use of ConcurrentSkipListSet to implement a thread-safe leaderboard. The Player class implements the Comparable interface to compare players by score. The ConcurrentSkipListSet class uses a skip list for storage, and it provides methods for navigating and searching the elements in the set. Multiple threads add players and scores concurrently to the leaderboard, and the program prints the leaderboard.

Note: ConcurrentSkipListSet is a collection that stores elements in a sorted order, and it uses a skip list for storage. It is useful for implementing thread-safe and sorted lists, and other similar operations.
