Certainly! I'll create a JUnit script that demonstrates the use of tags. Tags in JUnit 5 are used to categorize tests, which can be helpful for organizing and selectively running tests. Here's an example JUnit script that uses tags:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Tag;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

public class CalculatorTest {

    @Test
    @Tag("math")
    @Tag("addition")
    public void testAddition() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(5, calculator.add(2, 3), "2 + 3 should equal 5");
    }

    @Test
    @Tag("math")
    @Tag("subtraction")
    public void testSubtraction() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(1, calculator.subtract(3, 2), "3 - 2 should equal 1");
    }

    @Test
    @Tag("math")
    @Tag("multiplication")
    public void testMultiplication() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(6, calculator.multiply(2, 3), "2 * 3 should equal 6");
    }

    @Test
    @Tag("math")
    @Tag("division")
    public void testDivision() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertEquals(2, calculator.divide(6, 3), "6 / 3 should equal 2");
    }

    @Test
    @Tag("error")
    public void testDivisionByZero() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        assertThrows(ArithmeticException.class, () -> calculator.divide(1, 0), "Division by zero should throw ArithmeticException");
    }
}
```

In this example, we've created a test class `CalculatorTest` that tests various operations of a hypothetical `Calculator` class. Here's a breakdown of the script:

1. We've imported the necessary JUnit 5 annotations and assertion methods.

2. Each test method is annotated with `@Test` to indicate it's a test method.

3. We've used the `@Tag` annotation to categorize our tests:
   - All mathematical operations are tagged with "math"
   - Each operation is also tagged with its specific type (e.g., "addition", "subtraction")
   - The division by zero test is tagged with "error"

4. We've used various assertion methods like `assertEquals` and `assertThrows` to verify the expected behavior of our Calculator methods.

To use this script, you would need to have a `Calculator` class with methods like `add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`. The actual implementation of these methods is not shown here, as the focus is on the test script.

When running these tests, you can use tags to selectively run certain groups of tests. For example:

- To run all math tests: `mvn test -Dgroups="math"`
- To run only addition tests: `mvn test -Dgroups="addition"`
- To run all tests except error tests: `mvn test -Dgroups="math" -DexcludedGroups="error"`

Remember to configure your build tool (like Maven or Gradle) to use JUnit 5 for these tag-based test selections to work.
