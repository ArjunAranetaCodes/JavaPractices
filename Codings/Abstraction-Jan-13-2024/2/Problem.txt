Problem 2: Abstract Animal Class

Description: Create an abstract class called "Animal" with abstract methods "makeSound()" and "move()." 
Implement two concrete subclasses, "Dog" and "Fish," that extend the "Animal" class 
and provide their own implementations for the abstract methods. 
Write a main program that creates instances of both subclasses and calls their methods.
