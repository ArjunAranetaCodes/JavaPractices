Description: Create an abstract class called "Shape" with an abstract method called "calculateArea()." 
Implement two concrete subclasses, "Circle" and "Rectangle," that extend the "Shape" class and provide 
their own implementations for the "calculateArea()" method. 
Write a main program that creates instances of both subclasses and prints their areas.
