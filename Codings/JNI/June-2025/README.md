## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before running any of these JNI examples, ensure you have:

1. **Java JDK** (version 8 or higher)
   - Download from [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) or [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.org/)
   - Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

2. **C Compiler**:
   - **Windows**: Microsoft Visual Studio or MinGW
   - **Linux/macOS**: GCC (usually pre-installed)

3. **JNI Headers**: Included with JDK installation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Compile and Run All Programs

**Using Makefile (if available):**
```bash
# Navigate to any program directory
cd 01-FileOperations
make run

cd ../02-SystemInfo
make run

# Continue for other programs...
```

**Using Build Scripts:**

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd 01-FileOperations
build.bat run

cd ..\02-SystemInfo
build.bat run

# Continue for other programs...
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
cd 01-FileOperations
./build.sh run

cd ../02-SystemInfo
./build.sh run

# Continue for other programs...
```

**Manual Compilation:**
```bash
# For each program directory:
javac *.java
javah -jni [ClassName]

# Windows:
cl /LD -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include" -I"%JAVA_HOME%\include\win32" *.c /Fe:[LibraryName].dll

# Linux/macOS:
gcc -shared -fPIC -I"$JAVA_HOME/include" -I"$JAVA_HOME/include/linux" -o lib[LibraryName].so *.c

# Run:
java -Djava.library.path=. [ClassName]
```
