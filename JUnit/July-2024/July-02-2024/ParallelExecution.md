Certainly! I'll create a JUnit test that demonstrates parallel execution. We'll use JUnit 5 (Jupiter) for this example, as it provides built-in support for parallel execution. Here's a sample test class with parallel execution:

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.Execution;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.parallel.ExecutionMode;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.ParameterizedTest;
import org.junit.jupiter.params.provider.ValueSource;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertTrue;

@Execution(ExecutionMode.CONCURRENT)
class ParallelExecutionTest {

    @Test
    void test1() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Test 1 running on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        assertTrue(true);
    }

    @Test
    void test2() throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Test 2 running on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Thread.sleep(1000);
        assertTrue(true);
    }

    @ParameterizedTest
    @ValueSource(ints = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
    void parameterizedTest(int value) throws InterruptedException {
        System.out.println("Parameterized test with value " + value + " running on thread: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        Thread.sleep(500);
        assertTrue(value > 0);
    }
}
```

To enable parallel execution, you need to create a configuration file named `junit-platform.properties` in your test resources folder (typically `src/test/resources`) with the following content:

```
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.enabled = true
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.default = concurrent
junit.jupiter.execution.parallel.mode.classes.default = concurrent
```

Here's an explanation of the code and configuration:

1. The `@Execution(ExecutionMode.CONCURRENT)` annotation at the class level indicates that the tests in this class can be run concurrently.

2. We have two simple test methods (`test1` and `test2`) and one parameterized test method. Each method prints the thread it's running on and includes a small delay to simulate work.

3. The `junit-platform.properties` file enables parallel execution and sets the default execution mode to concurrent for both methods and classes.

When you run this test class, you should see that the tests are executed in parallel, potentially on different threads. The exact output may vary, but you might see something like:

```
Test 1 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1
Test 2 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2
Parameterized test with value 1 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-3
Parameterized test with value 2 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-4
Parameterized test with value 3 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-5
Parameterized test with value 4 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-1
Parameterized test with value 5 running on thread: ForkJoinPool-1-worker-2
```

This demonstrates that the tests are indeed running in parallel on different threads, potentially reducing the overall execution time of your test suite.

Remember that when writing parallel tests, you need to ensure that your tests are thread-safe and don't have shared mutable state that could cause race conditions or other concurrency issues.
