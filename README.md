| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)        |   A non-access modifier used for classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods within them are meant to be implemented by derived classes. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract) assert         | Used for debugging. It checks a boolean expression, throwing an error if the result is false. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)boolean        | A data type that can store only true and false values. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)break          | Breaks out of a loop or a switch block, terminating the loop prematurely. |

| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)case           | Marks a block of code in switch statements, specifying the code to be executed if the switch expression matches the case value. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)catch          |Catches exceptions generated by try statements.|
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)char           |A data type that is used to store a single character.|
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)class          |Defines a class.|
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)const          |Defines a constant.|
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)continue       |Used in loops to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.|
| default        |Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement, executed when none of the specified cases match the given value.|
| do             |Used in conjunction with 'while' to create a do-while loop, ensuring the loop body is executed at least once.|
| else           |Used in conditional statements to specify the block of code to be executed when the 'if' condition is false. |
| enum           |Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type, defining a set of named constant values. |
| exports        |Exports a package with a module. |
| extends        |Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class). |
| final          |A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes, and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). |
| finally        |Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not. |
| float          |A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e−038 to 3.4e+038. |
| for            |Create a for loop.|
| goto           | (Note: Not in use, and has no function) Not in use, and has no functional purpose.|
| if             |Makes a conditional statement, executing a block of code if the specified condition is true.|
| implements     |Implements an interface.|
| imports        |Used to import a package, class, or interface, allowing their use in the current Java file.|
| instanceof     |Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface.|

| short          |A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767.|
| static         |A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.|
| strictfp       |Restricts the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations.|
