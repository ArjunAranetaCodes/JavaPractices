| Keyword        | Description   |
| -------------- |:-------------:|
| abstract       | A non-access modifier used for classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods within them are meant to be implemented by derived classes. |
| assert         | Used for debugging. It checks a boolean expression, throwing an error if the result is false. |
| boolean        | A data type that can store only true and false values. |
| break          | Breaks out of a loop or a switch block, terminating the loop prematurely. |
| byte           | A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 to 127.|
| case           | Marks a block of code in switch statements, specifying the code to be executed if the switch expression matches the case value. |
| catch          |Catches exceptions generated by try statements.|
| char           |A data type that is used to store a single character.|
| class          |Defines a class.|
| const          |Defines a constant.|
| continue       |Used in loops to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.|
| default        |Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement, executed when none of the specified cases match the given value.|
| do             |Used in conjunction with 'while' to create a do-while loop, ensuring the loop body is executed at least once.|
| else           |A data type that can store floating-point numbers with double precision.|
| enum           |Used in conditional statements to specify the block of code to be executed when the 'if' condition is false.|
| exports        |Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type, defining a set of named constant values.|
| extends        |Exports a package with a module. |
| final          |A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes, and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class).|
| finally        |Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not. |
| float          |A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e‚àí038 to 3.4e+038. |
| for            |Create a for loop.|
