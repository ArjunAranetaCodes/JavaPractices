| Keyword        | Description   |
| -------------- |:-------------:|
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)        |   A non-access modifier used for classes and methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and abstract methods within them are meant to be implemented by derived classes. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract) assert         | Used for debugging. It checks a boolean expression, throwing an error if the result is false. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)boolean        | A data type that can store only true and false values. |
| [abstract](https://github.com/ArjunAranetaCodes/JavaPractices/tree/main/Keywords/abstract)break          | Breaks out of a loop or a switch block, terminating the loop prematurely. |
| byte           | A data type that can store whole numbers from -128 to 127.|
| case           | Marks a block of code in switch statements, specifying the code to be executed if the switch expression matches the case value. |
| catch          |Catches exceptions generated by try statements.|
| char           |A data type that is used to store a single character.|
| class          |Defines a class.|
| const          |Defines a constant.|
| continue       |Used in loops to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and move on to the next iteration.|
| default        |Specifies the default block of code in a switch statement, executed when none of the specified cases match the given value.|
| do             |Used in conjunction with 'while' to create a do-while loop, ensuring the loop body is executed at least once.|
| else           |Used in conditional statements to specify the block of code to be executed when the 'if' condition is false. |
| enum           |Declares an enumerated (unchangeable) type, defining a set of named constant values. |
| exports        |Exports a package with a module. |
| extends        |Extends a class (indicates that a class is inherited from another class). |
| final          |A non-access modifier used for classes, attributes, and methods, which makes them non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override). |
| finally        |Used with exceptions, a block of code that will be executed no matter if there is an exception or not. |
| float          |A data type that can store whole numbers from 3.4e‚àí038 to 3.4e+038. |
| for            |Create a for loop.|
| goto           | (Note: Not in use, and has no function) Not in use, and has no functional purpose.|
| if             |Makes a conditional statement, executing a block of code if the specified condition is true.|
| implements     |Implements an interface.|
| imports        |Used to import a package, class, or interface, allowing their use in the current Java file.|
| instanceof     |Checks whether an object is an instance of a specific class or an interface.|
| int            |A data type that can store whole numbers from -2147483648 to 2147483647.|
| interface      |Used to declare a special type of class that only contains abstract methods.|
| long           |A data type that can store whole numbers from -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775808.|
| module         |Declares a module. |
| native         |Specifies that a method is not implemented in the same Java source file (but in another language).|
| new            |Creates new objects.|
| package        |Declares a package.|
| private        |An access modifier used for attributes, methods, and constructors, making them only accessible within the declared class.|
| protected      |An access modifier used for attributes, methods, and constructors, making them accessible in the same package and subclasses.|
| public         |An access modifier used for classes, attributes, methods, and constructors, making them accessible by any other class.|
| requires       |Specifies required libraries inside a module. |
| return         | Finished the execution of a method and can be used to return a value from a method.|
| short          |A data type that can store whole numbers from -32768 to 32767.|
| static         |A non-access modifier used for methods and attributes. Static methods/attributes can be accessed without creating an object of a class.|
| strictfp       |Restricts the precision and rounding of floating-point calculations.|
| super          |Refers to superclass (parent) objects.|
| switch         |Selects one of many code blocks to be executed.|
| synchronized   |A non-access modifier that specifies that methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.|
| this           |Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.|
| throw          | Creates a custom error.|
| throws         |Indicates what exceptions may be thrown by a method.|
| transient      |A non-access modifier that specifies that an attribute is not part of an object's persistent state.|
| try            |Creates a try...catch statement. |
| var            |Declares a variable. |
| void           |Specifies that a method should not have a return value.|
